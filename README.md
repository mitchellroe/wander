This is a README for this new repository.

this is a test voice to text message period hopefully this actually works well, and if it does, then I can use it while I'm on the trails period

I'll try this if I am just using the English keyboard without multi-language support. let's see how well this one works instead. oh wow this is much better. apparently it was trying to match up my voice to both English words and German words, and failing to do so.
